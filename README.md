This is the second version of my Odin Project 'Landing Page' project from the foundations path. I wan to re-do it with a little more of my touch with the colors, design, etc. It will also help me practice more CSS. Hoping I can make this one a little better than my first landing page, even if the improvement is small. I will base this landing page off mid-century modern furniture with a green colorway instead of blue.


Reflection:
I thought after doing this one time that it would be easier the second time around. I was stuck on stuff with flexbox that I orginally had figured out without the need of looking back at any code. I was kind of disappointmented in myself in the way that I had to compare my old code to the one I wrote for this. I still had a lot of fun making this landing page. I liked adding the hover effects on the buttons and images, I think it adds so much even if it's just a small effect. I really want to work on responsiveness of the pages, but I guess I will have to learn that further down The Odin Project.
